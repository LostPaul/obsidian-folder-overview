# Folder overview for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

This plugin provides a dynamic overview of your vault or folders in the format of a code block.

## Documentation
The documentation of the plugin can be found here: https://lostpaul.github.io/obsidian-folder-notes/Folder%20overview/

## Folder notes plugin relation
This plugin offers the same functionality as the folder overview feature in the Folder Notes plugin. However, it is not intended to replace that feature. Instead, it serves as a standalone alternative for users who only need the folder overview functionality without the additional features of the Folder Notes plugin.

It can be used alongside the Folder Notes plugin, but to do so, you must first disable the Folder Notes plugin, then enable the Folder Overview plugin, and finally re-enable the Folder Notes plugin. Additionally, the Folder Notes plugin must be at least version 1.7.35.

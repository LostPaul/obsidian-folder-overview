## Folder notes plugin relation
**It can't be used when the folder notes plugin is also enabled. If you already have the folder notes plugin installed you don't need to also install the folder overview plugin.**

This plugin offers the same functionality as the folder overview feature in the Folder Notes plugin. However, it is not intended to replace that feature. Instead, it serves as a standalone alternative for users who only need the folder overview functionality without the additional features of the Folder Notes plugin.
